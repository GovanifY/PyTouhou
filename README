About this project:
-------------------

This project is an attempt to rewrite the engine behind The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (EoSD),
a popular danmaku (bullet hell) game published for Windows by Team Shanghai Alice in 2002.
Although the main reason behind this project is sheer curiosity, other motivations are portability and extendability.
Additionally, this project aims for a perfect compatibility with the official game, and thus become some sort of reference implementation.



Dependencies:
-------------

    * Python2 (>= 2.6)
    * Pyglet



Documentation:
--------------

The code should be sufficiently documented for anyone interested to learn how the EoSD engine work,
but additional documentation is available at:
